Or that they would confer together about both my diseases , I’m used to it now but in the early days the treatment plans have clashed once on biologicals it has become easier as the drug covers both but it is complicated and as I’m ageing both of my diseases are changing !! 

Also even though my diseases are remission most of the time it has still required me to completely change my lifestyle mostly because of the effects of fatigue !! I am just not able to do all the things I want to achieve but more importantly I have to say NO to many things and people just have no perception of quite how exhausting the diseases are and because I take a biological they assume I’m cured / on top form !!! Without realising the effort involved in coping with side effects 

 I am most definitely now able to live a full and happy life on biologicals but it takes a lot of planning and is an all day daily task !!

I have elderly parents , children with partners , young grandchildren , a sister having breast cancer treatment and a husband and like everyone else it’s a busy life and they all need me but I also have two chronic illnesses which if they had their way would have me bedridden and permanently on a toilet !!! 
Society and life don’t give you a break and it’s learning the way to cope with it all and manage that’s key so anything you can do to help us to do that would be wonderful .

My I just say Thankyou !! Knowing that people care and are trying to make a difference for us is super encouraging!!

Even though I am technically remission I have many complicated symptoms as a result of a hemicolectomy in 1989 carried out as an emergency and then a resection in 2014. My issues often feel dismissed by clinicians and the wider IBD community. This gets very tiring and my quality of life has been significantly affected since the second surgery. I have not been over seas on holiday for 8 years or eaten out. My diet is so restricted I can sometimes struggle to work a full day away from home. This has restricted my career opportunities and lifestyle overall. Further research addressing pthe needs of patients who have had multiple surgeries would be great.

Is there any correlation between bowel and bladder issues, e.g. is it normal/common to have issues with both? 

I’d also be interested to understand what it really means to be “remission” - since starting imraldi my bowel symptoms have become significantly more manageable, but at the same time I am always completely exhausted and am always unwell.

I’ve struggled with inconsistent consultations and advice during 2 flare ups. I’m feel a bit lost with it all sometimes and usually end up waiting until I’m really struggling with blood/mucus/fatigue before seeking advice. I understand I am not nearly affected as some people but I do feel isolated as I don’t know anyone else who has collitis so it can be difficult explaining how unwell I feel with a condition that’s not visible. I finished steroids around 5 weeks ago and I am starting to see mucus again but feel Im not unwell enough yet to make contact with the IBD team as they probably deal with really ill people needing support and at the moment, I’m doing ok.
